# Ready.io - server.js

Typescript framework for agile development



### First of all

I am giving the first steps with this so there is not much to see yet, I am still with a lot of ideas and deciding which implement before, a lot of doubts and I could decide to totally change anything from a version to another. All can be very unstable for now, so if there is someone on the Internet checking this humble project, and want to install it, do it at your own risk :).

### Why?

For some time I have had the idea of starting with this project mainly because I can and have the time to do it, but also because I have felt led to it. In my day as a web developer, I feel that I need a solid and general structure in all my projects,  basically a frame of reference with well-defined patterns that force me to be more organized, and a base that has everything I need to focus only in the application logic forgetting all the trivial. My motivation is to create something cool, to be more productive and efficient, in reality, there is a lot of ground to cover, with ideas that I have and learning from other frameworks and libraries. Of course, I want to achieve something different and contribute new ideas that may be useful for someone else.
